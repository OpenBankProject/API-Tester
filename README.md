# API Tester

This is a Django project to test the Open Bank Project API from the outside.

It currently supports three authentication methods: OAuth1.0a, Gateway Login and Direct Login



# Installation (development)

It is assumed that the git checkout resides inside a project directory, e.g. inside `/var/www/apitester` and thus to be found at `/var/www/apitester/API-Tester`.
Paths below are relative to this README. Files produced during installation or at runtime should be outside the git checkout, but inside the project directory, except for Django's local settings. 
The directory tree might look like:

```bash
$ tree -L 2 apitester/
apitester/
├── API-Tester
│   ├── apitester
│   ├── apitester.service
│   ├── gunicorn.conf.py
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── nginx.apitester.conf
│   ├── NOTICE
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── requirements.txt
├── logs
├── static-collected
│   ├── admin
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   ├── js
└── venv
    ├── bin
    └── lib
```


## Install dependencies

```bash
$ /usr/bin/virtualenv --python=python3 ../venv
$ source ../venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Configure database

The application's authentication is API-driven. However, to make use of Django's authentication framework, sessions and to store test configurations, the system requires a database. Here is an example for PostgreSQL:

```bash
$ /usr/bin/sudo -iu postgres
$ psql
# CREATE DATABASE apitester;
# CREATE USER apitester WITH PASSWORD '<pw>';
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE apitester TO apitester;
\q
exit
```

There is also an example using sqlite, see 'configure settings'.


## Get API Key
We need to register API Tester as an App / Consumer of the API we are testing.

When the Consumer / App is created on the API, **the redirect URL MUST point to this host**, e.g. `http://localhost:8084`

Make sure you don't add a trailing slash to the redirect URL etc.




## Configure settings

Create and edit `apitester/apitester/local_settings.py`:




### Postgres Example

```python
# Used internally by Django, can be anything of your choice
SECRET_KEY = '<random string>'
# API hostname, e.g. https://api.openbankproject.com
API_HOST = '<hostname>'

# Consumer key + secret to authenticate the _app_ against the API


OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY = '<key>'
OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET = '<secret>'

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'apitester',
        'USER': 'apitester',
        'PASSWORD': '<pw>',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
```

### Sqlite3 Example
If you're using sqlite:

```python
import os                                                                        
BASE_DIR = './'                                                                  
# Used internally by Django, can be anything of your choice                      
SECRET_KEY = '<random string>'                                                   
# API hostname, e.g. https://api.openbankproject.com 
# API OBP URL                            
API_HOST = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'                                                           
# Consumer key + secret to authenticate the _app_ against the API                
OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY = '<key>'                                                     
OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET = '<secret>'                                               
# Database filename, default is `../db.sqlite3` relative to this file            
DATABASES = {                                                                    
    'default': {                                                                 
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',                                  
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '..', '..', 'db.sqlite3'),                
    }                                                                            
}
#API Tester URL
REDIRECT_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8000'

```


## Initialise database

Note: Database migrations are part of the source code and will come from this repository. If you make changes and need to run makemigrations by yourself, commit them afterwards.

```bash
(venv)$ ./apitester/manage.py migrate
```


## Run the app

```bash
(venv)$ ./apitester/manage.py runserver localhost:8084
```

The application should be available at `http://localhost:8084`.



# Installation (production)

Execute the same steps as for development, but do not run the app.


## Settings

Edit `apitester/apitester/local_settings.py` for _additional_ changes to the development settings above:

```python
# Disable debug
DEBUG = False
# Hosts allowed to access the app
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '<your public hostname here>']
# Directory to place static files in, defaults to `../static-collected` relative to this file
STATIC_ROOT = '<dirname>'
# Admins to send e.g. error emails to
ADMINS = [
        ('Admin', 'admin@example.com')
]
# Emails are sent from this address
SERVER_EMAIL = 'apitester@example.com'
# Emails are sent to this host
EMAIL_HOST = 'mail.example.com'
# Enable email security
EMAIL_TLS = True
```


## Static files

The app's static files, e.g. Javascript, CSS and images need to be collected and made available to a webserver. Run

```bash
(venv)$ ./apitester/manage.py collectstatic
```

The output will show where they are collected to (`settings.STATIC_ROOT`).


## Web application server

Instead of Django's built-in runserver, you need a proper web application server to run the app, e.g. `gunicorn`. It should have been installed already as a dependency and you can use the provided `gunicorn.conf.py`. Run it like

```bash
(venv)$ cd apitester/ && gunicorn --config ../gunicorn.conf.py apitester.wsgi 
```

- `gunicorn` does not start successfully when omitting the directory change and using `apitester.apitester.wsgi` as program.
- The app's output is logged to `gunicorn`'s error logfile (see `gunicorn.conf.py` for location)


## Process control

If you do not want to start the web application server manually, but automatically at boot and also want to restart automatically if it dies, a process control system comes in handy. This package provides configuration files for systemd and supervisor.

### systemd

Stick the provided file `apitester.service` into `/etc/systemd/system/`, edit to suit your installation and start the application (probably as root):

```bash
# /bin/systemctl start apitester
```

If it works properly, you might want it to be started at boot:

```bash
# /bin/systemctl enable apitester
```

If you need to edit the service file afterwards, it needs to be reloaded as well as the service
```bash
# /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
# /bin/systemctl restart apitester
```

### supervisor

Stick the provided file `supervisor.apitester.conf` into `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`, edit to suit your installation and restart supervisor (probably as root):

```bash
# /bin/systemctl restart supervisor
```


## Webserver

Finally, use a webserver like `nginx` or `apache` as a frontend. It serves static files from the directory where `collectstatic` puts them and acts as a reverse proxy for gunicorn. Stick the provided `nginx.apitester.conf` into `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`, edit it and reload the webserver (probably as root):

```bash
# /bin/systemctl reload nginx
```



# Authentication


## OAuth

When selecting `OAuth` for authentication, the user is redirected to the login screen of the API from which the user is then redirected back to the API Tester. For this to work, the API Tester needs to be a registered consumer and the `OAUTH_` settings need to be set correctly.


## DirectLogin

Before being able to use `DirectLogin`, the user needs to create a consumer at the API, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/consumer-registration because the user needs to supply a consumer key in addition to username and password.


## GatewayLogin

For `GatewayLogin` to work, the user's provider has to be set to `Gateway` in field `resourceuser`.`provider_` in the database. The user also needs to know the pre-shared secret between the gateway and the API.



# Management

The app should tell you if your logged in user does not have the proper role to execute the management functionality you need. Please use a Super Admin user to login at an API Manager instance or API Explorer and set roles accordingly. To become Super Admin, set the property `super_admin_user_ids` in the API properties file accordingly.

# Usage

1) Login as the user that you will execute the tests as.

2) Create a "profile". 

Enter the API version (e.g. 3.1.0) that you want to test and values for commonly used fields. These values will be used as the defaults in urls and POST bodies but you can change the values for each URL.

3) Save the profile. This will generate tests for every endpoint in the version you specified.

4) Now you can change the URLs / POST bodies and Test each endpoint, all or the selected endpoints.

Note: 

You can change the order in which tests are run.

A user can have multiple test profiles.

# Final words

Be aware of file permission issues and preconfigured paths to executables (system env versus virtual env)!

Enjoy,
